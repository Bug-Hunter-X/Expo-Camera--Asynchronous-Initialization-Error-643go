# Expo Camera: Asynchronous Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: attempting to access camera features before the camera has fully initialized. The issue is rooted in the asynchronous nature of camera initialization.  The provided solution showcases proper asynchronous handling using promises and states to ensure that camera operations are performed only after successful initialization.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using Expo Go or a similar Expo client.
4. Observe the initial error and then the successful operation after implementing the solution.

## Solution

The solution leverages React's state management to track the camera's initialization status. Camera operations are only executed once the `isCameraReady` state is set to `true`, ensuring that the camera is properly initialized before access.
